This was the right move as internet speeds were increasing and moving towards broadband. Netflix was even considering launching a TV box if internet speeds remained constant. I agree that streaming video is a disruptive technology for Netflix, requiring a different strategy. Adopting a disruptive technology, Netflix forced Blockbuster to offer the mail-in-DVD service. By the time Blockbuster offered the mail-in-DVD service, Netflix had already begun experimenting with streaming videos and had started offering the streaming video platform. Netflix made Blockbuster dance to its tunes. Netflix, currently valued at $150 billion, changed its business model twice by cannibalizing its core services, shifting from mail-in- DVD service to subscription service to streaming video subscription service. This strategic renewal is one of the critical reasons for Netflix to become a valuable company and one of the pioneers in cloud computing that defined the architecture for AWS and set the freedom and responsibility culture for other silicon valley firms to emulate."}

{"instruction": "Why Do We Need GIS?", "input": "", "output": "GIS use has become mandatory in many settings. GIS are used to fight crime, protect endangered species, reduce pollution, cope with natural disasters, treat epidemics, and improve public health; GIS are instrumental in addressing some of our most pressing societal problems.GIS tools in aggregate save billions of dollars annually in the delivery of goods and services. GIS regularly helps in the day-to-day management of many natural and man-made resources, including sewer, water,power, transportation networks, and package delivery. GIS are at the heart of one of the most important processes in U.S. democracy, decadal redrawing of U.S. congressional districts, and hence the distribution of tax dollars and other government resources.GIS are needed in part because human consumption has reached levels such that many resources, including air and land, replacing substantial limits on human action.The first 100,000 years of human existence caused scant impacts on the world's resources, but in the past 300 years humans have permanently altered most of the Earth's Surface. The atmosphere and oceans exhibit a decreasing ability to benignly absorb carbon dioxide and nitrogen, two of humanity's primary waste products. Silt chokes many rivers, and there are abundant examples of smoke, ozone, or other noxious pollutants substantially harming public health. By the end of the 20th century, most lands south of the boreal region had been farmed, grazed,cut, built over, drained, flooded, or otherwise altered by humans. GIS help us identify and address environmental problems by providing crucial information on where problems occur and who are affected by them. GIS helps us identify the source, location, and extent of adverse environmental impacts, and may help us devise practical plans for monitoring, managing, and mitigating environmental damage.Human impacts on the environment have spurred a strong societal push for the adoption of GIS. Conflicts in resource use,concerns about pollution, and precautions to protect public health have led to legislative mandates that explicitly or implicitly require the consideration of geography. The U.S. Endangered Species Act (ESA) is a good example. The ESA requires adequate protection of rare and threatened organisms. This entails mapping the available habitat and species range and migration patterns, relative to human land use. \nGIS use is mandated in other endeavors, including emergency services, flood protection, disaster assessment and management, and infrastructure development.Public organizations have also adopted GIS because it aids in governmental functions. For example, emergency service vehicles are regularly dispatched and route using GIS. E911 GIS matches the caller's address to the nearest emergency service station, a route is generated based on the streetnetwork and traffic, and emergency crews dispatched in a fraction of the pre-GIS times.Many businesses adopt GIS for increased efficiency in the delivery of goods and services. Retail businesses locate stores based on a number of spatially related factors. Where are the potential customers?What is the spatial distribution of competing businesses? Where are potential new store locations? What are traffic flows near current stores, and how easy is it to park near and access these stores? GIS are also used in hundreds of other business applications, toroute vehicles, guide advertising, design buildings, plan construction, and sell real estate.The societal push to adopt GIS has been complemented by a technological pull in the development and application of GIS. Thousands of lives and untold wealth have been lost because ship captains could not answer the simple question, “Where am I?”Remarkable positioning technologies, generically known as Global Navigation SatelliteSystems (GNSS), are now indispensable tools in commerce, planning, and safety.The technological pull has developed on several fronts. Spatial analysis in particular has been helped by faster computers with more storage, and by the increased interconnectedness via mobile networks. Most real-world spatial problems were beyond the scope of all but the largest organization until the 1990s. GIS computing expenses are becoming an afterthought as costs decrease and performance increases at dizzying rates. Powerful field computers are lighter, faster,more capable, and less expensive, so spatial data display and analysis capabilities may always be at hand.In addition to the computing improvements and the development of GNSS, current “cameras” deliver amazingly detailed aerial and satellite images. Initially,advances in image collection and interpretation were spurred by World War II and then the Cold War because accurate maps were required, but unavailable.Turned toward peacetime endeavors, imaging technologies now help us map food and fodder, houses and highways, and most other natural and human-built objects. Images may be rapidly converted to accurate spatial information over broad areas. Many techniques have been developed for extracting information from image data, and also for ensuring this information faithfully represents the location, shape, and characteristics of features on the ground. Visible light,laser, thermal, and radar scanners are currently being developed to further increase the speed and accuracy with which we map our world. Thus, advances in these three key technologies — imaging, GNSS, and computing — have substantially aided the development of GIS."}

{"instruction": "what is entropy", "input": "", "output": "Entropy is a scientific concept, as well as a measurable physical property, that is most commonly associated with a state of disorder, randomness, or uncertainty. The term and the concept are used in diverse fields, from classical thermodynamics, where it was first recognized, to the microscopic description of nature in statistical physics, and to the principles of information theory. It has found far-ranging applications in chemistry and physics, in biological systems and their relation to life, in cosmology, economics, sociology, weather science, climate change, and information systems including the transmission of information in telecommunication.\n\nThe thermodynamic concept was referred to by Scottish scientist and engineer William Rankine in 1850 with the names thermodynamic function and heat-potential. In 1865, German physicist Rudolf Clausius, one of the leading founders of the field of thermodynamics, defined it as the quotient of an infinitesimal amount of heat to the instantaneous temperature. He initially described it as transformation-content, in German Verwandlungsinhalt, and later coined the term entropy from a Greek word for transformation. Referring to microscopic constitution and structure, in 1862, Clausius interpreted the concept as meaning disgregation.\n\nA consequence of entropy is that certain processes are irreversible or impossible, aside from the requirement of not violating the conservation of energy, the latter being expressed in the first law of thermodynamics. Entropy is central to the second law of thermodynamics, which states that the entropy of isolated systems left to spontaneous evolution cannot decrease with time, as they always arrive at a state of thermodynamic equilibrium, where the entropy is highest.\n\nAustrian physicist Ludwig Boltzmann explained entropy as the measure of the number of possible microscopic arrangements or states of individual atoms and molecules of a system that comply with the macroscopic condition of the system. He thereby introduced the concept of statistical disorder and probability distributions into a new field of thermodynamics, called statistical mechanics, and found the link between the microscopic interactions, which fluctuate about an average configuration, to the macroscopically observable behavior, in form of a simple logarithmic law, with a proportionality constant, the Boltzmann constant, that has become one of the defining universal constants for the modern International System of Units (SI).\n\nIn 1948, Bell Labs scientist Claude Shannon developed similar statistical concepts of measuring microscopic uncertainty and multiplicity to the problem of random losses of information in telecommunication signals. Upon John von Neumann's suggestion, Shannon named this entity of missing information in analogous manner to its use in statistical mechanics as entropy, and gave birth to the field of information theory. This description has been identified as a universal definition of the concept of entropy."}

We think so. Here are our top reasons to live in the beautiful state of Arizona. \n\n \n\n1. Great Places to Live\n \n\nOne popular benefit of living in Arizona is the relatively low cost of living.\n\n \n\nFamilies are moving to Arizona for affordable housing and a better quality of life. Here are some of our favorite cities.\n\n \n\nPhoenix\n \n\nNicknamed the \"Valley of the Sun,\" Phoenix is a bustling city with a great combination of a thriving job market, affordable living, and many ways to enjoy the outdoors.\n\n \n\nPhoenix has it all. From professional sports to amazing eateries to great shopping districts, there's so much to do in Phoenix. \n\n \n\nIt's a popular spot for young professionals, families, and retirees too. It's home to Arizona State University, dozens of museums, and endless outdoor adventures. And people are flocking to Phoenix, making it one of the fastest growing cities in the country.\n\n \n\nLitchfield Park\n \n\nThis beautiful city is located 16 miles from downtown Phoenix and is known for the gorgeous palms and orange trees that line the major streets. Families are attracted to the beautiful homes, great schools, and low crime rate in Litchfield Park.\n\n \n\nWith a quaint small-town feel, residents can walk or ride their bikes to more than 20 special events and festivals the town hosts each year. Some amenities include walking paths, six parks, baseball and soccer fields, and first-class golf courses.\n\n \n\nCasa Grande\n \n\nCasa Grande is the largest city in Pinal County. It's a beautiful modern city with a rich cultural heritage.

Lovely homes, high-performing schools, a low crime rate, and easy access to great shopping and entertainment make Goodyear a wonderful place to call home.\n\n \n\nQueen Creek\n \n\nThis suburb of Phoenix in Maricopa County is the perfect place to live and play in Arizona. Friendly residents, a rural feel, and great schools make Queen Creek a popular moving destination for families.\n\n \n\nSome amenities include beautiful parks, horseback riding trails, museums, and farm tours. A mix of luxury and affordable homes plus the gorgeous outdoor scenery help make Queen Creek a great place to live, work, and play.\n\n \n\n2. Strong Job Market\n \n\nPeople move from all over the country to Arizona for job opportunities. The job growth rate in Arizona is double the national average.\n\n \n\nThe state government is the largest employer in the state. And the largest private employer is Banner Health, which is based in Phoenix.\n\n \n\nJob opportunities in Arizona's many industries are plentiful. Top employment sectors include financial services, transportation, travel and tourism, utilities, technology, education, healthcare, and hospitality.\n\n \n\nIf you're looking for a job, Arizona has something for you.\n\n \n\n3. Sunny Climate\n \n\nIf you like it hot, you'll love Arizona. They have an average of 320 sunny days each year. Phoenix, the state capital, has more sunny days than any other large city in the country.\n\n \n\nIf you're sick of the snow and long cold winters, Arizona may be for you. Many people find the hot, dry climate beneficial for Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD), seasonal allergies, arthritis, asthma, and other health conditions.\n\n \n\nYou'll want to protect yourself from the sun's rays in Arizona. Temperatures can escalate at times to well over 100 degrees Fahrenheit. So, you need to use sunscreen, stay hydrated, and stay indoors when it gets too hot to venture out.\n\n \n\n4. The Grand Canyon\n \n\nPeople come from around the world to see this natural wonder. If you want to hike, explore, or camp in one of the most majestic spots on earth, you'll love the Grand Canyon.\n\n \n\nOver 5 million people visit the Grand Canyon each year to take in the breathtaking scenery. The canyon is 227 miles long, 18 miles wide, and a mile deep.\n\n \n\nBe sure to check out Grand Canyon National Park to enjoy hiking, fishing, cycling, boating, horseback riding, and many other outdoor activities. If you haven't seen it before, it's worth the time to step into nature, explore, and take in all the amazing sights.\n\n \n\n5. Cultural Attractions\n \n\nArizona is home to a variety of football, baseball, hockey and basketball teams, including the Cardinals, Suns, Coyotes and Diamondbacks. Children's sports programs are thriving in the state, and soccer programs are growing in popularity.\n\n \n\nThere are several noteworthy museums for visiting, including the Heard Center, the Phoenix Art Museum and the Artistic Photography Center.

There's something for everyone in Arizona.\n\n \n\n6. Amazing Sunsets\n \n\nYou can't find anything more beautiful than an Arizona sunset. Almost every night the sky is ablaze with gorgeous shades of red, yellow, and orange across the horizon.\n\n \n\nWhether you're taking a walk, driving home from work, or gazing into the sunset, you can't help noticing these amazing sunsets and drinking in the beauty of Arizona's sparse yet unique desert landscape.\n\n \n\nIf you haven't watched the sunset while hiking the Grand Canyon, it's an experience you don't want to miss.\n\n \n\n7. Beautiful Sedona\n \n\nAlong with the Grand Canyon, add Sedona to your to-do list. It's about 100 miles south of the canyon.\n\n \n\nSedona is famous for its beauty, mild climate, and diverse artistic community. You can explore the red-rock buttes, canyons, and various hiking trails.\n\n \n\nTake a hot air balloon ride if you're feeling adventurous and enjoy the amazing views of the desert, steep canyon walls, and red-rock formations.\n\n \n\n8. Forget Daylight Savings Time\n \n\nWhen you live in Arizona, you don't have to worry about setting the clock back or forward for daylight savings time.\n\n \n\nIn Arizona, the residents never think about it because it doesn't exist. So, no more arriving an hour early or late for work because you forgot to set the clock.\n\n \n\nArizona has so much to offer. And this is just one more small reason to love Arizona.\n\n \n\n9. Retirees' Paradise\n \n\nRetirees are flocking to Arizona for its great weather, affordable housing, and low taxes. There's no tax on social security and public pensions qualify for a tax deduction. \n\n \n\nArizona has plenty of affordable housing and retirement communities for seniors, and property taxes are lower than the national average. There's no sales tax on groceries, which is another big plus.\n\n \n\nThere's plenty to keep active seniors busy, like local sporting events, the great outdoors and top-rated golf courses.\n\n \n\nThese are just a few of the benefits of living in Arizona. It's is a great place to visit and an even better place to call home."}

Now this may come as a shock to you, but I really don’t appreciate the messes you leave around the house, the constant barking at random things outside, your lack of personal hygiene, and just your overall presence in general.\n\nTo put it into terms you can understand: You’re messy, you’re loud, you stink, and I want you out of the house.\n\nNow I can appreciate that this may come as a surprise to you.

{"instruction": "Describe the governing arrangements provided by the Articles of Confederation. What were the main weaknesses of the document?", "input": "", "output": "The Articles of Confederation (AoC) was the first written constitution of the United States. There were various governing arrangements provided by the AoC, but the most important was protecting the power or sovereignty of the states.  The state would not have ratified the AoC if the federal government did not guarantee the powers of the states. The AoC defined a federal government with a unicameral legislature (one vote per state).  This legislation had the following powers: declare war, conduct “foreign or commercial relations with other countries” (i.e. treaties), and executive functions that would be carried out by legislative committees. It also “suggested a federal court system”.  This federal government was to be funded by the states.\nThough it provided these powers to the federal government, there were inherent weaknesses built into the federal government. First, there was no way for the legislature to enforce its decisions. Second, a declared war or commercial treaty required the consent of at least 9 states. Even if a war was approved, there was no federal army, only state militias. Third, the federal government relied on the states for funding.  If the states didn’t like legislation passed, they could simply withhold funding. Fourth, amendments to the AoC required the unanimous agreement of all thirteen states.  A realization came that these weaknesses inhibited the governing ability of the federal government.  This set the stage for dropping the AoC, which then lead to the current Constitution of the United States."}

{"instruction": "What causes rain?", "input": "", "output": "Rain is the byproduct of the natural cycle of evaporation and condensation that happens all over the world. Moisture evaporates into the atmosphere from bodies of water and soil. Once this moisture is aloft in the atmosphere, certain conditions cause it to precipitate in the form of rain. These conditions include changes in atmospheric pressure, orographic lift cause by hilly terrain, and changes in temperature. Once the moisture starts to condense into larger and larger droplets, they eventually become heavy enough to fall from the cloud in the form of rain drops. This cycle then continues on with the newly fallen rain beginning to evaporate into the atmosphere."}

{"instruction": "Is plastic bad for us?", "input": "", "output": "Have you ever thought about where your plastic water bottles go? It probably ends up in a landfill, where it will decompose for over 1000 years as it deposits toxic chemicals. Plastic is an invention that has done more harm than good. There are about 363,762,732,605 pounds of plastic covering the earth. Most of this plastic can’t be recycled. Although people think it is too expensive or inconvenient to get rid of plastics, we should reduce the amount of plastic used or increase the price of plastics. One reason is that when plastic invades a balanced ecosystem, it corrupts it completely. The marine biome is one that is affected by this product. The animals in the ocean die of suffocation, ingestion of plastics, and entanglement. The animals affected are seagulls, whales, seals, fish, and turtles, and that's just a few. The animals eat so much plastic that they die of constipation from it. Another reason is the presence of microplastics in food and people. About 99% of fish have microplastics in their stomachs, livers, and filets (the meat of fish). Approximately 80% of cows have microplastics in their meat and milk. A good point is that mealworms and waxworms are studied to digest plastics, and they should be added to landfills to break down plastics. There are about 50,000 particles of plastic in an adult person, and this number is rising fast. Third, most plastic is littered. There are about 10 million tons of plastic litter every year. Every week, you ingest about a credit card's worth of plastic. There are about 44 million pounds of plastic that are produced that is very deadly to the environment.\"The plastic in the environment is in your water, food, and body. These plastics should not be there; they can lead to cancer, according to a recent study. We need to stop using plastic in our lives. Some ways we can reduce the amount of plastic on earth are by using sustainable materials such as wood, plant fibers, and mushroom styrofoam. We can also try to buy recyclable plastics that have a triangle formed by three cycling arrows. Use a tote bag instead of a plastic one, or a metal and glass straw instead of a plastic one. You can also use a metal cutlery kit instead of plastic. These are all ways you can make a difference in your everyday life."}
{"instruction": "What is the major source of income in Ethiopia and why its important?", "input": "", "output": "Agriculture is the backbone of the economy and the main source of livelihood for the majority of the population. However, traditional agricultural practices have led to soil degradation and deforestation. Farmers in Ethiopia often rely on a few staple crops, such as teff, wheat, and maize, which are grown repeatedly on the same plot of land without proper rotation or replenishment of soil nutrients (International Labour Organization). This leads to reduced yields, which can make it difficult for farmers to produce enough food to feed their families and earn a living. Deforestation, which is also a major problem, has been driven by the need for more land to grow crops. Ethiopia has one of the highest deforestation rates in the world, with an estimated loss of 1.1 million hectares of forest every year (World Bank)."}

{"instruction": "Who is Malcolm X?", "input": "", "output": "Malcolm X (born Malcolm Little, later el-Hajj Malik el-Shabazz; May 19, 1925 – February 21, 1965) was an American Muslim minister and human rights activist who was a prominent figure during the civil rights movement. A spokesman for the Nation of Islam until 1964, he was a vocal advocate for Black empowerment and the promotion of Islam within the Black community. A posthumous autobiography, on which he collaborated with Alex Haley, was published in 1965.\n\nMalcolm spent his adolescence living in a series of foster homes or with relatives after his father's death and his mother's hospitalization. He committed various crimes, being sentenced to 10 years in prison in 1946 for larceny and burglary. In prison he joined the Nation of Islam (adopting the name Malcolm X to symbolize his unknown African ancestral surname while discarding \"the White slavemaster name of 'Little'\"), and after his parole in 1952 quickly became one of the organization's most influential leaders. He was the public face of the organization for 12 years, advocating Black empowerment and separation of Black and White Americans, and criticizing Martin Luther King Jr. and the mainstream civil rights movement for its emphasis on nonviolence and racial integration. Malcolm X also expressed pride in some of the Nation's social welfare achievements, such as its free drug rehabilitation program. From the 1950s onward, Malcolm X was subjected to surveillance by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI).\n\nIn the 1960s, Malcolm X began to grow disillusioned with the Nation of Islam, as well as with its leader, Elijah Muhammad. He subsequently embraced Sunni Islam and the civil rights movement after completing the Hajj to Mecca, and became known as \"el-Hajj Malik el-Shabazz,\" which roughly translates to \"The Pilgrim Malcolm the Patriarch\". After a brief period of travel across Africa, he publicly renounced the Nation of Islam and founded the Islamic Muslim Mosque, Inc. (MMI) and the Pan-African Organization of Afro-American Unity (OAAU). Throughout 1964, his conflict with the Nation of Islam intensified, and he was repeatedly sent death threats. On February 21, 1965, he was assassinated in New York City. Three Nation members were charged with the murder and given indeterminate life sentences; in 2021, two of the convictions were vacated. Speculation about the assassination and whether it was conceived or aided by leading or additional members of the Nation, or with law enforcement agencies, has persisted for decades.\n\nA controversial figure accused of preaching racism and violence, Malcolm X is also a widely celebrated figure within African-American and Muslim American communities for his pursuit of racial justice. He was posthumously honored with Malcolm X Day, on which he is commemorated in various cities across the United States. Hundreds of streets and schools in the U.S. have been renamed in his honor, while the Audubon Ballroom, the site of his assassination, was partly redeveloped in 2005 to accommodate the Malcolm X and Dr. Betty Shabazz Memorial and Educational Center."}

The elite will see them including any existing forms of their government as a liability. There would be absolutely no functioning government in any part of the world and access to the elite cities or areas will be cut off from the rest of the population. The only people saved would be famous artists or athletes or anyone with creative skills. Rest of the people will be left to fend for themselves and all the progress made as a civilized society will be lost. Whomever is able to survive will set up small communities and continue life. But life will be hard for lack of food and medical care. Some communities may attempt to take out the elite cities but will fail. Eventually the 99% would perish after a few hundred years. The elites will have problems of their own like fights between corporations. But almost all of them will survive for generations and several thousands of years until some catastrophic event wipes them all out be it an alien invasion or something from natural causes."}

Finally, there’s evidence that suddenly stopping aspirin can actually increase the risk of a heart attack or stroke. Thus, not everyone should be taking a daily low-dose aspirin - consult your doctor!"}

Running at least 3 or better 4 times a week will be necessary. You should gradually increase your training load. A good guidance is to not increase the total mileage by more than 10% per week. One of the weekly runs should be a long run. You can should start with a distance that you are able to currently run, and keep gradually increasing it every week until you are able to run 30 km. You shouldn't need training runs longer than that. You should be able to run 30 km about 6 weeks before your target marathon. In the last weeks before the marathon decrease it down to about 20 km. The other runs in the week should be shorter. You should start as short as you are comfortable, and then increase them until they are 10-12 km. You should run all these runs at an easy pace, that would allow you to hold a conversation.\nGood luck with your marathon!"}

Power-to-Weight ratio: F1 cars are also extremely light at around 800 kgs giving them a power-to-weight ratio of 12000-1400 hp/ton. For comparison, the best Porsche cars have a power-to-weight ratio of only 300-400 hp/ton.\n2. Aerodynamics: F1 cars are fitted with extremely sophisticated aerodynamics including a rear wing, front wing and body parts that help reduce aerodynamic drag for straight-line speeds while adding downforce to help around corners\n3. Tires: F1 tires are extremely large and sticky. This help the cars stick to the road as the car goes through turns very fast.\n4. Brakes: Lastly F1 brakes are very powerful and can slow down a car extremely quickly. This allows F1 cars to be at top speed for much longer before needing to slow down for taking a turn."}

{"instruction": "What options does the Federal Reserve have to fight inflation?", "input": "", "output": "The Federal Reserve is the central bank of the United States, and its remit is to provide the nation a more stable and durable monetary system. The Federal Reserve, or the Fed, is specifically tasked with maintaining maximum employment while ensuring price stability. The United States is currently experiencing persistent inflation. Typically, the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates when initially trying to combat inflation. The increased rates make lending more expensive, and subsequently discourages capital investment and borrowing. The added cost in turn reduces demand for products and services. Lower demand normally leads to dropping prices to try and motivate potential buyers. The other primary method involves open-market operations. When inflation is running higher than expected, the Fed can reduce the money supply by selling securities and taking currency out of circulation. Since there are fewer dollars in circulation, each remaining dollar is correspondingly worth more than it was before those transactions."}

Staying healthy will allow you to enjoy those distractions longer, but jokes aside it will make you feel energized, motivated and bring out the best in you.  When new discoveries in scenic areas are correctly applied, you don’t need to spend multiple hours at the gym, you don’t have to starve to achieve your goals, this concept was very enticing to me when I first learnt about the Sprint 8 program at my local gym.  I decided to give this a try!\n\nSprint 8 - Its a 20 minute routine, where you spend the first 30 seconds working out at the highest level of intensity (go all out) followed by 90 seconds of active recovery, repeat this 8 times..  You can use a bike, treadmill, elliptical whichever suits your style.  In all my life of being fairly active, Sprint 8 has the toughest workout, but over a year I could see significant results.  I was able to run faster, lower blood pressure, reduce fat percentage, and improve muscle mass.  The key differentiator about this program is that it engages all the three muscle fiber types and releases exercise induced growth hormones to help your body become stronger, leaner and healthier.\n\nAnother advantage is that this program really reduces any change of injury that one may face by running, heavy weight lifting etc therefore allowing you to sustain the exercise program for years to come.  \n\nGive this a try and gain the benefits of efficient exercising."}

Proteomics enables the identification of ever-increasing numbers of proteins. This varies with time and distinct requirements, or stresses, that a cell or organism undergoes.\n\nProteomics is an interdisciplinary domain that has benefited greatly from the genetic information of various genome projects, including the Human Genome Project. It covers the exploration of proteomes from the overall level of protein composition, structure, and activity, and is an important component of functional genomics.\n\nProteomics generally denotes the large-scale experimental analysis of proteins and proteomes, but often refers specifically to protein purification and mass spectrometry. Indeed, mass spectrometry is the most powerful method for analysis of proteomes, both in large samples composed of millions of cells and in single cells."}

His three laws of classical mechanics successfully predicted the behavior of solid bodies across all observable scales - from the motion of planets to falling apples. For over 250 years his laws were applied with greater and greater precision, always giving the correct answers.\n\nHowever, in the late 1800s physicists struggled to reconcile measurements of the speed of light with Newton's laws. This one of the observations that led to Einstein's Special Theory of Relativity.\n\nAlbert Einstein (1879-1955) was a German-born physicist who revolutionized our understanding of space, time and matter with his theories of relativity and quantum mechanics. His theories of special and general relativity changed our understanding of space and time and successfully explained the motion of light and the behavior of gravity.  His theories of quantum mechanics likewise revolutionized our understand of the sub-atomic world.\n\nIn addition to Newton and Einstein there are many other physicists who made groundbreaking discoveries,  including Galileo Galilei, James Clerk Maxwell,  Marie Curie, Neils Bohr, Richard Feynman, and Stephen Hawking."}

{"instruction": "Will robots ever feel and think like humans? Will these robots solve all of our problems, or will they spell the end of the human race?", "input": "", "output": "Imagine a world where hundreds of robots are working with humans. Some of them deliver food, and some might be working at a cafe or a restaurant. They are all around us, helping people to do many things. Sometimes, they can do what humans can’t do, and they can also sometimes perform better than humans. Nowadays, many scientists and engineers are arguing if artificial intelligence could dramatically make our lives better, or would it spell the end of the human race?\n    Robots and Artificial Intelligence(A.I. for short) are developing systematically but dramatically, so someday, they might feel and think like humans. For example, some robots can “feel” pain by detecting how strong the force is to technically “feel” the pain. Furthermore, robots can think like humans by programming them to think how humans do. However, robots have less flexible thinking, since they are only doing what others programmed them to do, especially robots like Industrial robots that are less complex.\n    However, because A.I. is developing at a great speed, it might eventually become a threat to the human race. Many people such as Steven Hawkings warned that as A.I. develops further, they might be unstoppable, and might become one of the most dangerous enemies. Furthermore, according to the UN, A.I. might have stereotypical thoughts about certain races because of people’s discriminative behavior, and it can further have an impact on judgment between many kinds of people. Primarily, robots and A.I. can be a threat to the human race, so we need to take care of its program and rule it better so that it can be a good tool that can improve our lives.\n    On the other hand, I think that although now, A.I. still has some difficulties in doing certain things, A.I. can solve some of our problems, and make our lives better, and easier. A.I. can solve many problems, and they can even do some work better than humans. For example, robots can go to dangerous places like space, deep sea, and poisonous areas. Furthermore, robots can do dangerous jobs like welding which is dangerous work that needs to be done precisely. Robots are used in places like this because Industrial robots can do work precisely, and they can even save the worker’s life. For another example, a remote robot called Canadarm2 that works in the International Space Station can help astronauts by doing work in space to help the other astronauts that make their life easier.\n    In conclusion, A.I. is starting to become part of our lives since it’s starting to think and feel like humans with a great speed, and although it might become a threat to human races, I still think A.I. can solve many problems by doing what we have trouble doing. Once, Nick Boston claimed that “Machine intelligence is the last invention that humanity will ever need to invent” which means that humans only need to make A.I. because it can do things that other materials can, and it can also create and build itself. Since robots and A.I. can do many things that can help people, A.I. starting to become our reliable assistants as long as we take care of them."}

The different pricing strategy includes using - 1. Cost-side factors (like fixed, variable costs, incremental break-even analysis); 2. Customer-side factors (like Economic Value Analysis (EVA); Price Elasticity of Demand; Measuring willingness to pay) 3. Competitive environment factors. \n\nBased on the business context, these strategies can be implemented with tacts like price discrimination (e.g., bundling); non-linear pricing; price promotions (e.g., hi-lo pricing); and most of all understanding consumer psychology with respect to pricing (anchoring effect, decoy pricing, compromise effect, charm pricing, etc)."}

{"instruction": "What are Uncontacted peoples?", "input": "", "output": "Uncontacted peoples generally refers to indigenous peoples who have remained largely isolated to the present day, maintaining their traditional lifestyles and functioning mostly independently from any political or governmental entities. However, European exploration and colonization during the early modern period brought indigenous peoples worldwide into contact with colonial settlers and explorers. As such, most indigenous groups have had some form of contact with other peoples. The term \"uncontacted\" therefore refers to a lack of sustained contact with the majority of non-indigenous society at the present time.\n\nThe Inter-American Commission on Human Rights refers to uncontacted peoples as \"indigenous peoples in voluntary isolation.\" These groups are defined by their general rejection of contact with anyone outside of their own people. This definition also includes groups who have previously had sustained contact with the majority non-indigenous society but have chosen to return to isolation and no longer maintain contact. As such uncontacted peoples are understood not as living in an anachronistic state of nature but rather as contemporaries of modernity.\n\nA 2009 United Nations report also classified \"peoples in initial contact\" as sharing the same characteristics but beginning to regularly communicate with and integrate into mainstream society.\n\nTo highlight their agency in staying uncontacted or isolated, international organizations emphasize calling them \"indigenous peoples in isolation\" or \"in voluntary isolation\". Otherwise they have also been called \"hidden peoples\" or \"uncontacted tribes\".\n\nHistorically European colonial ideas of uncontacted peoples, and their colonial claims over them, were informed by the imagination of and search for Prester John, king of a wealthy Christian realm in isolation, as well as the Ten Lost Tribes of Israel, identifying uncontacted peoples as \"lost tribes\".\n\nInternational organizations have highlighted the importance of protecting indigenous peoples' environment and lands, the importance of protecting them from exploitation or abuse, and the importance of no contact in order to prevent the spread of modern diseases.\n\nHistoric exploitation and abuse at the hands of the majority group have led many governments to give uncontacted people their lands and legal protection. Many indigenous groups live on national forests or protected grounds, such as the Vale do Javari in Brazil or the North Sentinel Island in India.\n\nMuch of the contention over uncontacted peoples has stemmed from governments' desire to extract natural resources. In the 1960s and 1970s, Brazil's federal government attempted to assimilate and integrate native groups living in the Amazon jungle in order to use their lands for farming. Their efforts were met with mixed success and criticism until, in 1987, Brazil created the Department of Isolated Indians inside of FUNAI (Fundação Nacional do Índio), Brazil's Indian Agency. FUNAI was successful in securing protected lands which have allowed certain groups to remain relatively uncontacted until the present day.\n\nA different outcome occurred in Colombia when the Nukak tribe of indigenous people was contacted by an evangelical group. The tribe was receptive to trade and eventually moved in order to have closer contact with settlers. This led to an outbreak of respiratory infections, violent clashes with narco-traffickers, and the death of hundreds of the Nukak, more than half of the tribe. Eventually, the Colombian government forcibly relocated the tribe to a nearby town where they received food and government support but were reported as living in poverty.\n\nThe threats to the Nukak tribe are generally shared by all peoples in isolation, particularly the outside world's desire to exploit their lands. This can include lumbering, ranching and farming, land speculation, oil prospecting and mining, and poaching. For example, then Peruvian President Alan García claimed in 2007 that uncontacted groups were only a \"fabrication of environmentalists bent on halting oil and gas exploration\". As recently as 2016, a Chinese subsidiary mining company in Bolivia ignored signs that they were encroaching on uncontacted tribes, and attempted to cover it up. In addition to commercial pursuits, other people such as missionaries can inadvertently cause great damage.\n\nIt was those threats, combined with attacks on their tribe by illegal cocaine traffickers, that led a group of Acre Indians to make contact with a village in Brazil and subsequently with the federal government in 2014. This behaviour suggests that many tribes are aware of the outside world and choose not to make contact unless motivated by fear or self-interest. Satellite images suggest that some tribes intentionally migrate away from roads or logging operations in order to remain secluded.\n\nIndigenous rights activists have often advocated that indigenous peoples in isolation be left alone, saying that contact will interfere with their right to self-determination as peoples. On the other hand, experience in Brazil suggests isolating peoples might want to have trading relationships and positive social connections with others, but choose isolation out of fear of conflict or exploitation. The Brazilian state organization National Indian Foundation (FUNAI) in collaboration with anthropological experts has chosen to make controlled initial contact with tribes. The organization operates 15 trading posts throughout protected territory where tribes can trade for metal tools and cooking instruments. The organization also steps in to prevent some conflicts and deliver vaccinations. However, FUNAI has been critical of political will in Brazil, reporting that it only received 15% of its requested budget in 2017. In 2018, after consensus among field agents, FUNAI released videos and images of several tribes under their protection. Although the decision was criticized, the director of the Isolated Indian department, Bruno Pereira, responded that \"The more the public knows and the more debate around the issue, the greater the chance of protecting isolated Indians and their lands\". He shared that the organization has been facing mounting political pressure to open up lands to commercial companies. He also justified the photography by explaining that FUNAI was investigating a possible massacre against the Flechieros tribe.\n\nRecognizing the myriad problems with contact, the United Nations Human Rights Council in 2009 and the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights in 2013 introduced guidelines and recommendations that included a right to choose self-isolation.\n\nThere have been reports of human safaris in India's Andaman Islands and in Peru, where tourism companies attempt to help tourists see uncontacted or recently contacted peoples. This practice is controversial."}

{"instruction": "Without quoting directly from the text give me a summary the game of chess", "input": "", "output": "Chess is a two player turn based abstract strategy board game with the goal of checkmating the opponents King. The game originated from a similar board game from India called Chatarunga, which was played during the 17th century.\n\nChess boards have 64 squares arranged into an 8x8 grid with alternating white and black squares. Each player controls 16 pieces: 1 king, 1 queen, 2 bishops, 2 rooks, 2 knights, and eight pawns. Each piece has a predefined mode of movement. Each player's pieces are uniformly colored; for example if player one has the white pieces, player one will start the match. \n\nCheckmating the opponents king requires the opponent to position their pieces into an attacking arrangement that prohibits the defending players king from moving. This is usually accomplished by closing in on their defending opponents king and systematically working towards positions where the king can no longer move without being taken. If the king is under attack (meaning the king is in a position where the opponents next move will take the king) the defensive player must either take the attacking piece with any piece on the board or move the king to a position where the king is no longer under attach, this configuration is called \"Check\" or being \"Checked\". Chess matches can also end in a draw.\n\nChess arose in popularity in the 19th century and is governed internationally by the FIDE (international chess federation). Magnus Carlsen is the current world champion (2023) and the game has a huge body of theory associated with playing the game. \n\nThe game has influenced western culture in the fields of art, mathematics, computer science and psychology. Computer scientists have used chess as a method for developing algorithms that can play chess.

A player is in an offside position if they are closer to the opposition's goal line than the last defender of the opposition team. \n\nThe law states that a player is in an offside position if any of their body parts, except the hands and arms, are in the opponents' half of the pitch, and closer to the opponents' goal line than both the ball and the second-last defender.\n\nBeing in an offside position is not an offence in itself, but a player so positioned when the ball is played by a teammate can be judged guilty of an offside offence if they receive the ball or will otherwise become \"involved in active play\", will \"interfere with an opponent\", or will \"gain an advantage\" by being in that position. Offside is often considered one of the most difficult to understand aspects of the sport."}

It began in the late 1800s. The sport dates back to to the civil war era, which is where it started to become known as America's pastime. It coincides with a plethora of historical and cultural aspects of life in America. While the game has a vast amount of historical significance, it also seems to reflect changes that occur in our society. For example, over the past several decades we have seen a huge influx in players from all over the globe, with greater representation from countries like Dominican Republic, Venezuela, Puerto Rico, Japan and many others. America has always been considered a land of opportunity and this is evident with baseball. The MLB is the most prestigious league when it comes to baseball and is dream destination for any player. If you are good enough, you are sometime given the opportunity to play here. Recently we have seen a huge increase in the international representation of players in the league. As times have changed and the world has become more global, we also see this transpire in baseball.

{"instruction": "What are different types of optical illusions?", "input": "", "output": "There are three types of optical illusions: Physical, physiological and cognitive.\n\nPhysical optical illusion occurs when the light bends or changes direction before it reaches human eye. When light travels through different mediums such as air , water or glass, its speed changes and change in speed causes the light to bend. This phenomenon is called refraction. Rainbow is an example of physical optical illusion caused by refraction.   \n\nPhysiological optical illusion occurs when a pattern repeats over and over again and it is too much information for the brain. This causes the brain to think the images are moving. Kinetoscope uses images to create a video using physiological optical illusion. Flip books are another example of physiological optical illusion. \n\nCognitive optical illusion occurs when multiple people view the same image but they interpret it differently. Interpretation of the image depends of people's past experience and personalities."}

While my dog doesn't got there for more than 9 hours, it is convenient that the daycare is open from 7am to 7pm in case I needed him to stay there longer. I like that they have two separate playrooms at our daycare, one for smaller breeds/older dogs/timid dogs, and the other for larger dogs/younger dogs who may want to roughhouse more. Another great benefit is that my daycare offers spa services for my dog like a bath, nail trimming, ear cleaning, teeth brushing, and I do take advantage of that every other month or so.

Warren was a candidate in the 2020 Democratic Party presidential primaries, ultimately finishing third.\n\nBorn and raised in Oklahoma, Warren is a graduate of the University of Houston and Rutgers Law School and has taught law at several universities, including the University of Houston, the University of Texas at Austin, the University of Pennsylvania, and Harvard University. She was one of the most influential professors in commercial and bankruptcy law before beginning her political career. Warren has written 12 books and more than 100 articles.\n\nWarren's first foray into public policy began in 1995, when she worked to oppose what eventually became a 2005 act restricting bankruptcy access for individuals. During the late 2000s, her national profile grew after her forceful public stances in favor of more stringent banking regulations after the financial crisis of 2007–08. She served as chair of the Congressional Oversight Panel of the Troubled Asset Relief Program, and proposed and established the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, for which she served as the first special advisor under President Barack Obama.\n\nIn 2012, Warren defeated incumbent Republican Scott Brown and became the first female U.S. senator from Massachusetts. She won re-election by a wide margin in 2018, defeating Republican nominee Geoff Diehl. On February 9, 2019, Warren announced her candidacy in the 2020 United States presidential election. She was briefly considered the front-runner for the Democratic nomination in late 2019, but support for her campaign dwindled. She withdrew from the race on March 5, 2020, after Super Tuesday."}
{"instruction": "What is the recipe for a successful hackathon?", "input": "", "output": "LabCorp had its second annual “Innovation Days” (or hackathon) event in February, 2020. The event was a success, and this post describes the secret ingredient that helped make it a success: Lipton® Onion Soup Mix. The soup mix captures the essence of a successful hackathon… some functional, and some personal to the LabCorp leadership.\n\nThe first reason that the soup mix embodies the spirit of the hackathon is simple: the product is rarely used as it was intended: to make soup. In fact, the soup mix launched into culinary notoriety in the early 1950s for its role in a non-soup recipe: potato chip dip. Referred to as “California Dip” originally, this recipe takes bland sour cream and gives it a flavorful zing and distinctive texture. For over half a century, this soup mix has been a party favorite thanks to people hacking a recipe and using materials in an unexpected manner. The benefit of the soup mix as a dip enhancer is that it helps speed up the process of making a consistently flavorful dip. For people participating in a hackathon, this is something to look for: can hackathon ideas or aspects of the hackathon projects be applied to existing processes to help streamline them?\n\nThe journey of “inventing” the soup mix also captures the essence of the hackathon. The engineer who helped create this soup mix had failed years earlier. He was not trying to make soup during the Second World War, he was trying to save lives. So he invented a - sadly ineffective - method for freeze-drying blood that could be reconstituted on the battlefield to save lives. His vision for “dried blood” being used on the battlefield was not viable. Let’s hope it did not require too many “QA” folks to realize this product was DOA. Years later, however, it was the method of freeze-drying that was in his mind when he helped design Lipton® Onion Soup Mix.\n\nLabCorp CIO, Lance Berberian told the origin story of Lipton® Onion Soup Mix as the keynote speaker during the Innovation Days event. Mr. Berberian recounted the story from his uncle, and, like many stories told by uncles, we hope it to be true. The take-away message, as it relates to hackathons: remember your failed attempts. Aspects of your failed attempts may be core to your future successes.\n\nMr. Berberian was very engaged in the hackathon. In fact, his leadership team was front-and-center on launch day as well as on presentation day. The story about his uncle was powerful because it set the tone for the event: experiment, learn, network, and expect the unexpected. And the unexpected did happen during the event. Near the end of presentation day, a participant in the audience suddenly collapsed and began seizing. Many folks rushed to help and call 911. As a compassionate leader, Mr. Berberian was on the front-lines of the incident, and he stayed with the sick colleague while we waited for an ambulance to arrive. This, I believe, captures the true secret ingredient of a successful hackathon: engaged leadership."}

Another part of the story was a patent dispute in 1898 between Thomas Edison and his patent for the Kinetograph.  Edison stated that he effectively had a say in how films were made and wanted royalties for their use.  Moving from New York near where Edison was based to Los Angeles was a simple way to grow the industry and distance themselves from a patent war.  \n\nThis mobility at the start of the modern film era due to costs continued through the 1960's and 1970's with westerns being shot in Spain.  The 1980's and 1990's continued this trend primarily shooting in Canada or Mexico.  At the turn of the century state legislators in the United States started provided steep tax rebates.  The practical outworking of this is studios are encouraged to hire local talent and use local services when producing their film.  The ratios for these rebates is fairly complicated and have created a new industry of tax professionals serving the film industry.\n\nSo then why Georgia?  Georgia currently provides one of the highest incentive structures at 20% with minimal restrictions on talent and a very low minimum budget of $500,000."}

THP Lamb turned from school teacher to fur trader and in 1900, started Lamb's Store in Moose Lake, Manitoba. Tom and his brothers and sisters grew up in northern Manitoba and worked for their father.\n\nTom Lamb left school before finishing grade 3. Later in life, he would make the comment, while giving his acceptance speech when receiving his honorary Doctorate of law from the University of Manitoba, \"If I had only gotten to grade 4\". At the age of 10, Tom, who had his own team of horses and sleigh, was competing with grown men in the fish hauling business. He would have to use fish boxes to step up on to be able to load his sleigh.\n\nOne of the Lamb family's businesses was \"logistics and transportation\". Fish, lumber, trees, fur and supplies needed to be hauled by any and all means. Dog teams, horses, boats, trucks and tractors were used. In the 1930s there was a transportation revolution happening. The aircraft was making its way into northern Canada. The first time Tom Lamb saw an aircraft he realized its potential. In 1930, Tom bought his first aircraft - a Stinson SR8. In 1930, Tom Lamb travelled to Winnipeg to learn to fly. To keep costs to a minimum, he lived in a tent behind the Winnipeg Flying Club. When he returned to The Pas and checked himself out on the Stinson.\n\nIn 1935, Tom incorporated Lamb Airways Limited. The airline had some name changes throughout the years and Tom became one of the best known Manitobans, if not Canadians, in the world.

Idle time is not my friend so I try to stay busy.   Today, I am busy reflecting upon my 56 years on Earth and lessons learned.  Not just lessons I learned from my personal experience, but what I believe are lessons learned for all mankind.  The lessons are clear.  And all of the lessons are simple practices that I feel we have drifted away from in our modern day.  If I had to summarize all of my learnings into one statement it would read like this... \"Live simply, love, find faith/hope in a higher source, move every day, work hard on relationships and building communities (real and face to face), find time to rest and creating space and be thankful.\"  That's it!  As I said, the lessons are clear.  I would like to think that life on Earth will somehow, someway start again and someone will find this diary.  And, if that happens, then maybe, just maybe, another human race can benefit from my feelings on life and \"living\"."}

Java applications are typically compiled to bytecode that can run on any Java virtual machine (JVM) regardless of the underlying computer architecture. The syntax of Java is similar to C and C++, but has fewer low-level facilities than either of them. The Java runtime provides dynamic capabilities (such as reflection and runtime code modification) that are typically not available in traditional compiled languages. As of 2019, Java was one of the most popular programming languages in use according to GitHub, particularly for client–server web applications, with a reported 9 million developers."}

{"instruction": "Write me a script for an upcoming All Hands meeting about our IPO prospects and how employees need to act in the quiet period.", "input": "", "output": "Lately, I've received plenty of questions about a potential IPO. I want to answer those questions today — and talk about how we as a company will answer questions like that moving forward.\n\nFor years, we’ve shared that one of our aspirations is to build a wildly successful public company. Everyone has a role to play in getting us there and delivering for customers and growing the business is the most important thing most of us can do.\n\nA typical milestone on a high-growth journey is an IPO. But as companies get more serious about a potential IPO, there is a period where they stop talking about an IPO.  This might be counter-intuitive, but here’s why: there are important regulatory restrictions on what companies can and cannot say when it comes to company growth and plans as they approach becoming a public company. The consequences if you don’t follow those rules can be serious — the SEC can even delay our ability to go public if it determines we’ve improperly promoted an IPO. And that’s obviously a situation we want to avoid, should we be in a position to go public in the future.  \n\nAnd even language like this — \"should we be in a position to go public in the future\" — is vague. That's for a reason: as we get closer to an IPO, what we can say is restricted and we need to make sure we don’t make promises, otherwise regulators could force us to delay our plans.\n\nSo I’m going to share some updates about how we’ll need to communicate related to a potential IPO:\n\nIn order to preserve the ability to IPO at some point in the future, the executive team and I will not be sharing explicit details on our IPO journey or timing at All Hands or in other company communications. We also won’t be sharing updates to our market valuation. \n\nHiring managers and recruiters should not explicitly talk about an IPO or our revenue growth with candidates. Instead, emphasize our massive opportunity, how we’re innovating, delivering value to our customers, and what an awesome team we have.  \n\nWe can’t engage with public market investors or financial journalists on certain topics. That means if a financial analyst, research analyst or reporter reaches out to you, don’t respond and forward the email to the communications team.\n\nWe also can’t talk about a potential IPO on social media or with friends and family. You get the idea.\n\nI know that this will be different for us. We’ve always been a transparent company and this change is hopefully a short-term one. But it is an important one and you all have a role to play in helping us remain compliant.\n\nWe all have different, important roles to play in making this company a successful, long-term business. The most important thing we can all do is to continue delivering for our customers and building a successful business."}
{"instruction": "How to be rich?", "input": "", "output": "While many people aspire to become rich, the reality is that it's an elusive dream for most of all, as less than 1% of the population ever achieve true wealth.

However, having a job that can sustain your daily life and your family is a good starting point. From there, you can think about ways to promote yourself and increase your income. It's also important to remember that richness is not just about money; emotional wealth, such as living a happy and fulfilling life and having no regrets, is also a form of richness."}

The interval between each successive pair of strings is a perfect fourth, except the major third interval between G and B, making some figures and phrases 'translate' horizontally across the neck. The perfect fourth interval helps avoid long finger stretches in comparison to the perfect fifth intervals on smaller instruments like the violin. The introduction of a major third between G and B means that the total interval between 1st and 6th string is 24 semitones, or 2 octaves, making the open guitar strings fall more easily into chords, aiding fretting of basic chords with fewer fingers."}

Other media outlets embraced the term as the tournament continued to sell out and thrive for decades. Brent Musburger, a former sportswriter from Chicago, brought the term \"March Madness\" to the NCAA tournament when covering the event for CBS in 1982. The phrase became synonymous with the tournament ever since. In 2010, the NCAA made it official and paid IHSA (The Illinois High School Association) $17.2M for the rights to the phrase, and began using the trademark in marketing materials, logos and other branding material. While only used for the men's tournament for decades, the NCAA only began using the phrase \"March Madness\" for the women's tournament in 2022."}

These reports have also stressed that there’s an immediate need to move away from these fuels in the near future. \n\nThe challenge to this paradigm shift from fossil fuels to renewable energy is a combination of social and political barriers, the cost for new infrastructure to manage new energy portfolios , fossil fuel phase-out may lead to an increment in electricity prices and challenges to energy storage. \n\nIn April 2022, McKinsey published their Energy Insights Global Energy Perspective report, where they highlighted a rapid increase in traditional energy ( Oil and Gas) over the next 5 years, however the report also shows a rise in renewable energy and Hydrogen following that 5 year mark. While each adoption of this will differ in each country, the consensus is we will have a mixed energy portfolio (renewables and traditional) for the next 3 decades.

{"instruction": "What is CRISPR?", "input": "", "output": "CRISPR  (an acronym for clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats) is a family of DNA sequences found in the genomes of prokaryotic organisms such as bacteria and archaea. These sequences are derived from DNA fragments of bacteriophages that had previously infected the prokaryote. They are used to detect and destroy DNA from similar bacteriophages during subsequent infections. Hence these sequences play a key role in the antiviral (i.e. anti-phage) defense system of prokaryotes and provide a form of acquired immunity. CRISPR is found in approximately 50% of sequenced bacterial genomes and nearly 90% of sequenced archaea.\n\nCas9 (or \"CRISPR-associated protein 9\") is an enzyme that uses CRISPR sequences as a guide to recognize and cleave specific strands of DNA that are complementary to the CRISPR sequence. Cas9 enzymes together with CRISPR sequences form the basis of a technology known as CRISPR-Cas9 that can be used to edit genes within organisms. This editing process has a wide variety of applications including basic biological research, development of biotechnological products, and treatment of diseases. The development of the CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing technique was recognized by the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 2020 which was awarded to Emmanuelle Charpentier and Jennifer Doudna.\n\nIn 2022, in a proceeding at the United States Patent and Trademark Office (interference 106,115), the Patent Trial and Appeal Board decided that the inventor for the US patent covering application of CRISPR-Cas9 in eukaryotic cells is Feng Zhang, a professor of the Broad Institute."}
{"instruction": "What are Calories, and what is the difference between good and bad calories?", "input": "", "output": "Calories are the physical units for measuring heat and energy. The nutritional energy contained in fat, protein, and carbohydrates (also knowns as macronutrients or macros for short) is expressed in kilocalories (kcal or Cal) and makes up your daily caloric intake. Our bodies need the energy provided by these macronutrients to function properly. If you consume fewer calories than you burn, you will lose weight. On the other hand, if you consume more calories than you consume, you will gain weight. Calories are categorized as good or bad based on the sources, and its positive or negative impacts on our body. Negative impacts to body include increased risk of cardiovascular diseases, inflammation, and depression. Bad calories come from sources like meat, fat, sugar and processed foods. Good calories come from eating a whole-grain diet high in fruits, vegetables, legumes, fish, and nuts. That said, you should listen to your body, and do what feels right and avoid thinking in terms of “good” or “bad” food. Just be aware of how different foods make you feel, and your mind will automatically tune into this over time and help you fight craving foods loaded with bad calories."}

{"instruction": "Why are dogs called dogs?", "input": "", "output": "About seven centuries ago, the word hound, which came from the Old English hund, was the word for all domestic canines. Dog was just used to refer to a subgroup of hounds that includes the lovely but frequently slobbering mastiff.\n\nOf course, the opposite is now true. We use dog to talk about all of man’s best friends, from lovable golden retrievers to panting chow chows. And hound is now used to indicate a type of dog used just for hunting. Hound especially refers to a dog with a long face and large, droopy ears. Linguists still speculate about the reversal of fortune for hound and dog. One idea suggests that the sub-breed known as dogs became so populous that dog simply became the generic term (sort of an animal equivalent of the way brand names can become so ubiquitous that they start to be used as a general term for their purpose)."}

{"instruction": "Extract the names of the teams Jubilee was a part of from the text. Separate them with a comma.", "input": "", "output": "Jubilee was created by writer Chris Claremont and artist Marc Silvestri and first appeared in The Uncanny X-Men #244 (May 1989). Claremont had earlier introduced a \"Jubilee\" of sorts in The New Mutants Annual #2 (1986). In that story, Darla of the Fat Boys, after being mentally and biologically warped, uses identical powers to those of the later Jubilation Lee and introduces herself as \"Jubilee! Whose every move is a celebration!\" In her first appearance Jubilation Lee gives a similar self-introduction: \"Actually, my name is Jubilee! 'Cause with me, every day's a celebration!\" Darla is returned to normal by the end of The New Mutants Annual #2, and no in-story connection between the characters is ever established.\n\nJubilee appeared regularly as an X-Men team member in The Uncanny X-Men through issue #280 (Sept. 1991), and later was a staple of X-Men (1991) as a member of the X-Men's Blue Team. During the same timeframe, she also served as Wolverine's sidekick in Wolverine vol. 2 #40–75 (1991–1993).\n\nAfter the Phalanx Covenant storyline in X-Men #16–17 and The Uncanny X-Men #316–317, Jubilee, who was then a teenager, was transferred to the X-Men trainee squad Generation X and starred in the entire run of Generation X #1–75 (1994–2001). After the dissolution of Generation X, Jubilee returned to the pages of The Uncanny X-Men, first as a member of the X-Corporation (#403–406, 2002), and later as a team member in her own right (#423–437, 2003–2004). Jubilee had a six-issue self-titled limited series in 2004 written by Robert Kirkman, but loses her mutant powers in House of M – The Day After #1 (Jan. 2006). She then adopts the alias Wondra and joins the reconstituted New Warriors in New Warriors vol. 4 #1–20 (2007–2009).\n\nJubilee is affected with vampirism during the \"Curse of the Mutants\" in X-Men vol. 3 #1 (July 2010) and remained a sporadic character on that title through issue #27 (April 2012), as well as a supporting character in X-23 vol. 3 (2010–2011). In 2011, she saw print in her second four issue limited series, Wolverine and Jubilee written by Kathryn Immonen and drawn by Phil Noto, as an aftermath follow-up to the Curse of the Mutants storyline. Jubilee later featured as a regular character in the all-female X-Men vol. 4 #1–25 (2013–2015), and as a supporting character in Patsy Walker, a.k.a. Hellcat! (2016). She returned as a main cast member in Generation X vol. 2 #1-9, #85-87 (2017-2018) as the adult mentor to the new teenage main characters, during which she was cured of vampirism and had her mutant powers restored."}

{"instruction": "What is connectomics?", "input": "", "output": "Connectomics is the production and study of connectomes: comprehensive maps of connections within an organism's nervous system. More generally, it can be thought of as the study of neuronal wiring diagrams with a focus on how structural connectivity, individual synapses, cellular morphology, and cellular ultrastructure contribute to the make up of a network. The nervous system is a network made of billions of connections and these connections are responsible for our thoughts, emotions, actions, memories, function and dysfunction. Therefore, the study of connectomics aims to advance our understanding of mental health and cognition by understanding how cells in the nervous system are connected and communicate. Because these structures are extremely complex, methods within this field use a high-throughput application of functional and structural neural imaging, most commonly magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), electron microscopy, and histological techniques in order to increase the speed, efficiency, and resolution of these nervous system maps. To date, tens of large scale datasets have been collected spanning the nervous system including the various areas of cortex, cerebellum, the retina, the peripheral nervous system and neuromuscular junctions.\n\nGenerally speaking, there are two types of connectomes; macroscale and microscale. Macroscale connectomics refers to using functional and structural MRI data to map out large fiber tracts and functional gray matter areas within the brain in terms of blood flow (functional) and water diffusivity (structural). Microscale connectomics is the mapping of small organisms' complete connectome using microscopy and histology. That is, all connections that exist in their central nervous system."}

{"instruction": "Write about the potential ethical concerns of de-identification techniques.", "input": "", "output": "One of the ethical issues associated with the technique of suppression is the further underrepresentation of historically underrepresented groups. For example, within the MOOC dataset there exists only one row affiliated with a user from Antartica (continent). Similarly, the following countries have also appeared once or twice only in the entire dataset: San Marino, Falkland Islands, and Brunei. Geographically underrepresented, these pieces of information would get entirely eliminated under the suppression technique. This presents an ethical paradox: on one hand, we wish to preserve k-anonymity and protect the privacy of users from underrepresented regions; on the other hand, to reach that goal we would have to erase their existence in the dataset and further reinforce the pre-existing underrepresentation. Another example would be the column of the year of birth. The MOOCs user population are overrepresented by young people, whereas users over 80 years old only take a proportion less than 1% in the entire dataset. In particular, if we were to use the suppression technique to achieve k-anonymity, almost every piece of information associated with users over 80 years old would have to be discarded. Again, the elderly have been historically underrepresented in the industry of education, yet by using suppression, we protect their privacy at the expense of representation.\n\nThis loss of representation as a result of suppression is detrimental at multiple aspects and therefore deserves attention. As the MOOCs platform is deprived of relevant information on these users, the company will lose sight of the potential demand that these underrepresented groups have for online education, thereby failing to reach them through marketing and advertisement. Besides straining the platform’s user base and profitability, this would worsen the situation that the underrepresented groups have limited resources to online education. Moreover, inferences on the suppressed dataset could reinforce the societal bias that certain groups of people are not open to education – such as the elderly – whereas the reality is simply that we erase the information on the elderly who actively engage in online education platforms. As a result, the elderly could feel themselves further distanced from the mainstream media and technology. Therefore, using suppression alone to achieve k-anonymity within a dataset, while effective, could be complicated by the ethical issue of underrepresentation."}

{"instruction": "What should I consider before taking a job with a lot of travel?", "input": "", "output": "Many people are attracted to jobs that have significant travel.  The allure of traveling to new and exciting places, the potential for airline and hotel program status benefits, meeting new people, etc.  All of these things may be exactly what you are looking for.  But my advice for anyone who is considering a position with significant travel and who has not experienced that type of work-life before is to think about all the things in their life that they are involved with that make them happy.  Think hard about whether you can take them on the road with you, reproduce them wherever your business travel takes you, or do without them.  Perhaps you have a standing poker night each month with your friends.  You may not be able to attend that with any regularity.  You may love the climbing gym or cycling club at home.  Can you replace that with hotel gyms?  Do you stick to a diet that will be hard to keep when you need to eat out a lot?  Do you have a relationship at home that will suffer if you are gone a lot?  The list can go on and on and is different for each person.  But it is critical to evaluate this aspect of how your life will change when you travel a lot of the time and make sure you are happy with the accommodations and changes you will need to make.  Another important consideration is whether you will be traveling to different time zones.  Often the idea of globetrotting to different parts of the world is very exciting, but you will have to deal with jetlag while maintaining your work performance.  You will end up dealing with canceled or delayed flights, traffic, and other types of travel disruptions.  Ultimately, a job with significant travel can involve a lot of excitement and fun.  But it is not right for everyone. It is not vacation travel.  And being honest with yourself about what changes you will need to make, what hassles you will need to deal with, and what you will have to give up will help you make the right decision.  And you will never truly know until you do it."}

This can be seen in a prism or a rainbow, where sunlight is separated into its component colors. When all these colors are combined, the result is white light.\n\nIn terms of pigments, white can be created by using a substance that reflects all colors and absorbs none. This means that when white light hits the surface of the object, it is reflected back to the viewer as white. Titanium dioxide is a common pigment used in white paint, for example, because it is highly reflective and opaque.\n\nIn the digital world, white is often created by using RGB color values of 255, 255, 255, which means that all three primary colors (red, green, and blue) are at their maximum intensity. This creates a pure white color on electronic displays."}

Lastly babies also tend to get bored and need constant attention and someone to play with them. If the baby continues to cry despite all your efforts, please do not lose your patience, stay calm and contact your friends or neighbors for help.

{"instruction": "Can you please describe the game of golf?", "input": "", "output": "Golf originated in Scotland in the 15th century. It is mostly regarded as an \"upper-class\" sport reserved for members of private country clubs, but has gained a lot of popularity over the last few decades. As a result, golf has become more broadly accessible to the general public, and today the sport is enjoyed by tens of millions of people around the world. \n\nIn golf, there are a total of eighteen stretches of grass, known as holes. Each hole is comprised of a tee box, where the golfer hits his or her initial shot, the fairway, and the green. Most holes also include deep grass that runs along the fairways, known as \"the rough\". For added difficulty, holes can also contain hazards like sand bunkers or bodies of water like ponds and creeks. A small circular hole is located on every green and is marked with a flag so that golfers can see it from far away. The objective is to get your golf ball from the tee box into that small hole in as few shots (known as \"strokes\") as possible. Golfers advance their ball by striking it with a golf club, and each ball strike is counted as a stroke. Golfers are allowed to use up to 14 golf clubs over the course of their round, each of which is used for different purposes, from different distances. Some clubs, like the driver, are used to hit the ball very long distances. In fact, most professional golfers are able to drive the ball over 300 yards. That's the length of three football fields! A combination of clubs called irons make up the majority of a set of golf clubs. They are are generally used to advance the ball to the green after the golfer hits his or her initial tee shot. The club face of each iron is designed with a different loft angle. Higher loft angles enable golfers to hit the ball higher in the air and shorter distances, whereas low loft angles produce lower trajectory shots that travel longer distances. The most frequently used club in the set is the putter, which is used to tap the ball from wherever it lies on the green into the hole. On average, most good golfers will putt the ball twice per hole, or approximately 36 times per round. \n\nGolf holes are designated as par 3, par 4, or par 5, depending on their length. These numbers are an indication of how many strokes it should take for a professional golfer to complete the hole. Par 3 holes are shorter, and should take a single stroke to get the ball from tee to green. Par 5 holes are longer, and should typically take three strokes to get from tee to green. Most golf courses have four par 3 holes, four par 5 holes, and ten par 4 holes, yielding an aggregate of par 72. At the end of a round of golf, players calculate their final score by aggregating their total number of strokes across all eighteen holes. Over time, the golfer's skill level is assessed by his or her \"handicap\", which is a system that reflects the average number of strokes over par that the player typically shoots. For example, if one's average round score is 79, their handicap is 7 because it's 7 strokes above par. The lower the handicap, the better the golfer."}
